I am Ibrahim Muhammad, I make ground segment software for Earth-Observation
satellites at UrtheCast. I was named one of the top [30 under 30](http://www.canadianbusiness.com/innovation/developer-30-under-30-gallery/image/22/)
developers in Canada.

I am a Full-Stack Software Engineer and an Agile Product Owner. In my spare time,
I tinker with machine learning and contribute to open-source.

I studied Software Systems at University of British Columbia and Mechanical
Engineering at American University of Sharjah.
