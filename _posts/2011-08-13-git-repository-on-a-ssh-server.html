While git is pretty useful for an individual developer on the local machine itself. Having your git repository in a central location allows you not only to work in teams but work on your project from different computers. 

The most straight-forward way I found to have a git 'server' is to put the repository on a ssh server. You can use a web host to host your repositories. Setting it up is easier than one would think.

On the server create a folder and initialize an empty repository.
{% highlight bash %}
git --bare init
{% endhighlight %}

On your development machine, you add a remote origin.

{% highlight bash %}
git remote add origin username@hostname.com:/directory/project.git
git push origin master
{% endhighlight %}

Thats it.
