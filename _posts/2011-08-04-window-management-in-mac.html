I recently got a Macbook Pro. It is really cool but its hard to keep track of your windows. There is this awesome program called <a href="http://code.google.com/p/shiftit/">Shift it</a> which makes your life a lot easier. Best of all its open source unlike most of the Mac applications that you have to pay for.
