There are a lot of benifits of being in a startup, like learning a lot
in a short time, working with smart people, having much more
responsibility and freedom then you would get in a larger organization.

Its hard to estimate if in the end you would really profit from your
startup financially. Lets say you have 3.5% equity at a startup valued
at $4 Million for an investment round. What can you expect to earn?
