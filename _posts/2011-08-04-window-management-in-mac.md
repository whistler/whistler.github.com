I recently got a Macbook Pro. It is really cool but its hard to keep track of 
your windows. There is this awesome program called [Shift it](http://code.googl
e.com/p/shiftit/) which makes your life a lot easier. Best of all its open 
source unlike most of the Mac applications that you have to pay for.
