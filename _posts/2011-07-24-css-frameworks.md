[Compass](http://compass-style.org/) is an opensource CSS framework which uses 
SASS to create variables, mixins, etc in CSS.

[Blueprint](http://www.blueprintcss.org/) is another CSS framework which 
creates a grid on webpages which can be used to easily create the layout of a 
web page.

It is easy to integrate them with Ruby on Rails by installing the compass gem.
