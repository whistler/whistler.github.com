Hiring Employees for Startups
=============================

Use your network
----------------
In the initial days it would be really hard to find talent, before you get funded its best to get people you already know to work with you.

Events
------


Part-time/Full-time
-------------------



Fire Fast
---------
While not having enough money, you might hire people who do not have relevant experience but are willing to learn to do the job, its should not be an excuse for poor performance. Startups already having a slim chance of surviving, giving an employee too many chances would make this chance slimmer. 

Hire Slow
---------
Firing is a painful job, its important to make sure you have the right fit with the employee. Get to know a candidate well. Whenever possible get them to work for a month with you on a trial basis before giving them an offer.
