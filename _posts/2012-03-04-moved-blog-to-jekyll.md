I have been using wordpress to host my website for more than 5 years, its a 
great platform. I like it because it comes with lots of nice themes, a good
number of plugins, is open source and I can freely edit and modify how my
site looks.

However, I just switched to [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) which
is a static site generator. It doesn't come with a huge array of features like
Wordpress but quite the opposite, its simple. 

Its easier to use my own theme written from scratch, I don't have to use a 
database, its easier to write posts using a text editor. With my new little 
website in place, I feel like I am going to write more often. :)
