I copied over my photos from my external hard drive on to my mac book. Apparently Macs are supposed to be good with all sort of multimedia things, iPhoto does look pretty good but it turns out it copies all photos to the iPhoto Library file. I just want it to leave my photos where they are. If I want to access my photos on a non-Mac machine it would be easy to do so.
