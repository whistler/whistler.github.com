title: Amazing Programming Font
tags: [fonts,linux,mac]
---
As stupid as it sounds, one of the reasons why I hate coding on Windows is 
because windows monospace fonts suck compared to what Linux has. I had windows
ports of Gedit and Geany on my network folder but Windows fonts were just 
painful to look at.

After spending some time with Mac, I am setting up my programming environment
on Linux box but I didnt like any of the monospace fonts installed by default.
Searching on the internet, I eventually found a font I liked and it turns out 
its Mac's monospace font called Monaco. Luckily, there is a way to [get in 
working on Linux](http://jorrel.blogspot.com/2007/11/monaco-on-ubuntu.html).

Its these little things that makes Mac so amazing.
