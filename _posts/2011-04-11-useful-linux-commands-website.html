I am working on a <a href="http://consoleguide.heroku.com">new website</a> which lists useful Linux commands. Basically a one-day spin off to keep me up to date with web programming. But I think that the website has potential.

At the moment, I am thinking of a easy (think zeroconf) sort of voting system for the website. I might end up using OpenID.
