Somehow the visual editor was not working on my wordpress installtion. I checked the server log and it turned out that the file permissions were not set up correctly. Just needed to give do <code lang="bash">chmod -R +r .</code> in the wp-includes/js directory to get it working again.

Also the previous syntax highlighter I had installed sucked. I tried out a couple and so far I only like <a href="http://kpumuk.info/projects/wordpress-plugins/codecolorer/" title="CodeColorer">CodeColorer</a> I also really like the syntax highlighter on this <a href="http://www.communityguides.eu/articles/15">website</a> but I dont know if that is available on wordpress.
