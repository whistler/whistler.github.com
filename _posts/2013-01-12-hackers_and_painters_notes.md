Some quotes I liked from Paul Graham's book:

> "Start by building something clean and simple, something you would want to use yourself"

> "The best thing software can be is easy, but the way to do this is to get the defaults right, not to limit users choices."

> "The top 5% of programmers probably write 99% of the good software"

> "Wealth is what people want"
