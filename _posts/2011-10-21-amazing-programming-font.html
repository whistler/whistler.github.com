Believe it or not, one of the reasons why I hated coding on my previous university's Windows machines was because windows' monospace fonts suck compared to what Linux has. I had windows ports of Gedit and Geany on my network folder but Windows fonts were just painful to look at. 

After spending some time with Mac, I am setting up my programming environment on Linux box but I didnt like any of the monospace fonts installed by default. Searching on the internet, I eventually found a font I liked and it turns out its Mac's monospace font called Monaco. Luckily, there is a <a href=http://jorrel.blogspot.com/2007/11/monaco-on-ubuntu.html>way</a> to get in running on Linux.

Its these little things that makes Mac so amazing.
