Ever since I watched a TED Talk, I forget which one, I have become fascinated
by the possibilities of controlling things with thought and finding more about
yourself. 

I really want to get my hands on one the the brain reading headsets and maybe
create an custom interface for my computer. It would be really cool to do even
the simplest things like switching between windows. Think about terminal go to
go to the last used terminal while programming, similarly switching to the code
editor and webbrowser in itself would be really cool.

Here are two hardware products I came across that are available to consumers:
* [Neurosky Mindwave](http://store.neurosky.com/products/mindwave-1)
* [Emotiv EPOC](http://www.emotiv.com/apps/epoc/299/)

Mindwave looks less scary and is also a third the cost but Emotiv probably has
better sensor.
