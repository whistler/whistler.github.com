Lessons learned from a year in enterpreneurship. Stuff I wish I had found out earlier and stuff I wish I actually followed.

Ideas are worthless
-------------------
If you have a brilliant idea which you havn't validated and created a prototype for, its worthless. If its a good idea, there are many people who have thought about it before. Most successful companies are not the first one trying out an idea - Google is not the first search engine, Heroku is not the first web applications host. Execution plays a great part. You idea actually becomes worth something when you have iterated over it several times, validated it and your prototype is making revenue.


Your Startup is your team
-------------------------
As the idea doesn't really matter, what matters is the team. Select the people in your team very carefully. Ideally you would want to start a company with someone you have known for a while and can fully trust. The team should be extremely accomplished, you do not want to work with mediocre people, at least in the beginning.


Iterate
-------
This concept has been repeated my many: solve the problem in the simplest way you can, get feedback, make small continuous improvements. 
[Read Eric Ries]


Validate before building
------------------------
Validate that the problem you are trying to solve is actually a problem. Validate that the solution is actually monetizable. There are many companies working on products that are either not really significant enough problems for people to pay money. 
 

Tell a great Story
------------------
You need to stand out, make sure whatever you do you can tell a great story. This will come naturally if what you are working on is a problem you face yourself, make sure you put some effort in how you pitch your startup and make people interested.


Inbound marketing
-----------------
Write a blog on topics related to your business. Not only would this show your potential customers that you actually care about what you are doing (and you better do), it would also make you more visible in search engines. 

A/B testing
-----------
This is not just changing the colour of the signup button when your product is ready and needs more traffic, AB test from the very beginning. Even when you are validating your idea, try out different ways to say what you business does(or might do in future)

Growth
------
Don't spend too much money on marketing when the product is not ready. When you reach product-market fit, aim for a constant growth rate. 
[Paul Graham]

Types of Markets
----------------
Understand what it really means to be a startup. You could be creating other kinds of businesses too. 
[Peter Theil]

Experimenting
-------------
Make sure you collect any interesting data to track user behaviour. Run data driven experiments and see what works and what does not. 


Focus on problem, not the solution
----------------------------------
Its easy to get attached to the product you are working so hard on. But what you should really get attached to is the problem and continuously think of how to solve the problem better rather the how to make the product better.


Include everyone in the conversation
------------------------------------
Make your whole team feel like they are a part of it. Ask them for their input, be transparent, make sure every one is as enthusiastic about the startup as you are. Get engineers to talk to customers.


I would love to hear if you disagree with anything I've said or would like to add anything to the list. I am in no way an experienced entrepreneur, however these are things I have learned from mingling with other startups, having been a founding member of Venio, going through the Extreme Startups program, listening to accomplished mentors and reading popular authors on the topic.
