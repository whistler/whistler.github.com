Over the last couple of months, I have realized that I have not been as productive as I would like to be. It's not that I am spending less time at work, but it feels like there is too much distraction these days. I used to be able to do things more efficiently when I spent a couple of hours doing just one thing and having a deadline for it. Now it seems that when I am working on something, new things come up, I leave some things unfinished to come back to later on and ultimately there are a gazillion windows open on my computer at some point my computer starts lagging and I decide to close everything. To be more productive, I have come up with some solutions.

Cut down email time - I get tons of emails from lots of places and had made it a point to read them all, but now I cut down email time to just one hour in the morning, try to read as much of it as I can and get rid of the rest. 

Do one thing at a time - Completely focus on just one thing at a time, put a deadline for yourself and try to meet it.

Divide tasks into subtasks - Its motivating to have things finished. If you just have a broader task listed on your todo list, it might be there for a couple of days, it feels nice to just put subtasks and see what you have completed at the end of the day.
