Ever since I got a VPS, I've encountered lots of locale problems.
I get problems like:

<code lang="bash">
setlocale: LC_ALL: cannot change locale (en_US.UTF-8)
</code>
and 
<code lang="bash">
perl: warning: Setting locale failed.
perl: warning: Please check that your locale settings:
	LANGUAGE = (unset),
	LC_ALL = "en_US.UTF-8",
	LC_MESSAGES = "POSIX",
	LC_CTYPE = "en_US.UTF-8",
	LANG = "en_US.UTF-8"
    are supported and installed on your system.
perl: warning: Falling back to the standard locale ("C").
locale: Cannot set LC_CTYPE to default locale: No such file or directory
locale: Cannot set LC_MESSAGES to default locale: No such file or directory
locale: Cannot set LC_ALL to default locale: No such file or directory
/bin/bash: warning: setlocale: LC_ALL: cannot change locale (en_US.UTF-8)
</code>
And every time I have reinstalled my Debian or Ubuntu distribution, I have solved it up in a different manner. 

Anyhow, the latest one has so far seemed the best
<code lang="bash">
apt-get install language-pack-en
</code>

My /etc/default/locales looks like this:
<code lang="bash">
root@ibslab:~# cat /etc/default/locale
LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8
LANG=en_US.UTF-8
LC_MESSAGES=POSIX
</code>
