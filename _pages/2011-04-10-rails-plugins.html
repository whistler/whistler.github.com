There are a lot of rails plugins out there. Selecting which ones to use in your application can be a daunting task. I have come across the <a href="http://www.ruby-toolbox.com/">Ruby Toolbox</a> listing which is very helpful but still feels incomplete. There are many more plugins available on GitHub.

Here are some of the plugins that I have used or am planning to use in my rails applications.
<ul>
<a href="http://norman.github.com/friendly_id">friendly_id</a> - SEO your website by using meaningful link names rather than their ids.
