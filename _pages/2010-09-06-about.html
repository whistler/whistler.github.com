Hello,

I am Ibrahim from Toronto. In past I have lived in Dubai and Karachi. I studied Mechanical Engineering at American University of Sharjah. I was working on an Autonomous Aerial Vehicle as my final year project.

I want to create innovative web and mobile application that are useful to people. At the moment I am working with Ruby on Rails to create a secret web application.
